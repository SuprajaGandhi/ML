Steps:
1. Read Train JSON 
2. Consider only title and abstractText columns as input
3. meshMajor column is the output
4. Since the output is the array of labels, I used MultiLabelBinarizer
5. Y column has around 20000 columns and it took so much to fir and classify. 
6. I used sparse_output=True to form a sparse matrix
7. For classification, I used RandomForestClassifier and TfidfVectorizer
8. Added the parameter stop_words='english' to ignore common words like, 'the',
'and', etc
9. Read Test JSON
10. With the classifier, I tried to fit the test data
11. Calculated accuracy, micro precision, micro recall and F1 score
12. Read Judge JSON
13. Predict the labels and add it to a JSON file
